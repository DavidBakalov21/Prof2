In case of long term support adapter pattern can be used to make

.asList() example 

Let's suppose that we have an array of values , both array and list are used to store values.However, there ara many methods are only available with list.
For that we can use asList method for array (for example contains)
Here are code example:

Integer[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
List<Integer> numList = Arrays.asList(nums);
boolean containsOne = numList.contains(1);
System.out.println(containsOne);
